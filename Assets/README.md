This game, developed by Cole Andrews, can be played with the WASD, TFGH, or Controller keybinds. 

Players can move around with the default keybinds of WASD, rotate with mouse, and shoot with LMB. The game menu can be opened with ESCAPE. Other keybinds are avaiable and can be viewed in the menu.

While in the menu the player can swap pages with the header navigation located at the top. 
	1. Inventory Page: players can select from the Quick Items to choose a new quick item. Only the four panes on the right currently work, in the future I'll add weapon and armor specific tabs. 
	2. Items page: players can look at their current items -- while in this page using the scroll wheel will cycle through the displayed items. 
	3. Stats Page: coming soon! 
	4. Settings Page: This page allows users to rebind keys, or change their current keybind layout which allows players to swap from keyboard to controller. 

Across the game there are a few key items the player can obtain, three guns and three heals. The three guns are the pistol, machinegune, and shotgun. Each has their own unique bullet firing pattern. 
The weapons can be equipped via the quick items panels in the inventory. Players can cycle through their currently selected quick item with the 1,2,3,4 key. 
Weapons can be fired with LMB (or the relative keybind) and consumables can be used with "E"

In the case of consumable items, such as the Battery Cell (a heal) using them will reduce their quantity by 1. Once the quantity reaches 0 it will be removed from the quick items and inventory. 

There are two enemies in the game. The first enemy will be idle until the player gets within 10 units, it will then begin to chase the player, shooting if it gets within 5 units. 
The second enemy uses waypoints to traverse the map and will chase the player if they get within 5 units, using a melee attack if they get within 2.
